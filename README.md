# Selenium WebDriver (C#) Project

This repository contains my Selenium WebDriver project written in C# from scratch. The project is designed to showcase my skills and demonstrate my understanding of test automation using Selenium WebDriver.

## Getting Started

To get started with this solution, you will need the following:

- Visual Studio (2019 or later)
- Chrome browser (latest version)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/QualityOwl/qowl-demo-selenium-webdriver.git`

2. Open the solution file 'WebDriverDemo.sln' in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution in Visual Studio.

## Usage

The solution contains a sample test case that demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions. To run the sample test case, follow these steps:

1. Open the Test Explorer window in Visual Studio by selecting 'Test' > 'Test Explorer' from the menu bar.

2. In the 'Test Explorer' window, select any test case of your choice and click the 'Run' button.

3. The Chrome browser will launch and the test case will execute. You should see the browser navigate to the Google homepage, complete the test steps, and validate the results.
